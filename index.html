            <h2>/ABOUTME</h2>
            <p>
            Born and raised in Nepal, I love to travel and am very passionate about Football (Soccer).‍ I was a Computer Science student at first, but I realized that I wanted to learn more about the business impact of the tools I was learning to use. So, I switched to Data Science, where I get to build machine learning models, learn to manipulate and transform data into usable insights, and solve business problems. In addition to that, I’m also minoring in International Economics, which gives me a better understanding of trade, supply and demand, and financial systems. I can confidently say that I am very passionate about machine learning algorithms, and I’m working to deepen my knowledge by reading more technical books beyond what is taught in class—I enjoy exploring different resources to expand my understanding. Aside from academics, I consider myself creative and open-minded, always trying to look at things from different perspectives to find alternative solutions that may not be obvious. I like to take initiative and work independently when I can, but I’m not afraid to ask for help when needed. You can find my projects, tools and work experience as you explore more.

            <h2>/GOALS</h2>
            <p>
            DATA SCIENTIST is the end goal for me. Someday, I want to become someone with enough knowledge to make decisions that require deep statistical analysis, build machine learning models to uncover patterns in data, and — most importantly — use all that knowledge in perfect symphony.‍ The path to becoming the best is very hard and challenging. With the right blend of technical knowledge, analytical thinking, understanding how machine learning algorithms work in the background, and awareness of the business side of decision-making, I believe I can get there. I am constantly honing my skills to reach that goal. To show how much I have learned and grown, I am actively looking for internships in technical roles involving ML/AI, data, and statistics in general. I believe I have a unique way of looking at problems and can contribute even more to the team if given the opportunity. Currently, I have been studying the course materials on Machine Learning Algorithms, Business use cases for ML models and so on. The following are my courses that deal with what was mentioned:
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>Applied Deep Learning</li>
            <li>Recommender Systems</li>
            <li>Exploratory & Advanced Data Analytics</li>
            <li>Data Science Programming</li>
            <li>Business Statistics, Calculus I & II, and Linear Algebra</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            I have also worked on projects involving fine-tuning LLM models to make their outputs more personalized. However, I paused that because I realized it was more important for me to first see and understand how different base machine learning algorithms work in action, including the mathematical principles behind them. I know how many machine learning and deep learning algorithms work in general, but to become the best, simply understanding the basics is not enough — I need to know every detail of their inner workings to fully grasp how LLMs operate. This is why, for now, I have set LLMs aside and am focused on deepening my technical knowledge of core machine learning algorithms.
            </p>
            <h3>WHAT I DO THE BEST?</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Read documentations for tools knowledge</li>
            <li>Understand the basics to get more technical</li>
            <li>Creative and analytical thinking</li>
            <li>Listen to actual talks regarding the problem</li>
            <li>Research</li>
            <li>And finally, go with the flow</li>

            <h2>/WHAT AM I WORKING ON CURRENTLY.</h2>
            <p>
            Currently, I am studying the technical aspects of machine learning algorithms and the math behind them. I know that, as an undergraduate student, the mathematics behind these algorithms can be quite complex, but my goal is to deepen my general understanding of machine learning and how it transitions into deep learning. I am also very interested in Bayesian probabilistic ML models and appreciate how they work in practice, despite their well-known drawback of a linear increase in parameters as data grows — meaning they often require twice the number of parameters compared to deterministic models for the same task. I am learning how these models work and how to use them effectively as I continue to expand my knowledge in this field. As for current projects, I am not actively working on one at the moment, but I do have ideas that I plan to develop soon.

                <p>I have worked on several LLM projects over time, but I haven’t uploaded them to my GitHub because the weights of the fine-tuned models are very large. However, I do have a solid understanding of how LLMs work in general and hands-on experience in fine-tuning them. I have studied different techniques used to improve LLM performance by reading research papers, books, and articles, and I have tried to replicate some of these methods myself. My practical work is limited mainly due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning LLMs. I will link the projects down below once I upload them.</p>
